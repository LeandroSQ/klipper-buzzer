# klipper-buzzer

This repo contains the tools for using a buzzer with Klipper.

## C - V2

### Installation

A complete **rewrite**, it **uses C and LGPIO with software PWM and timers** to play the tunes, the **performance impact is minimal while sound quality remains the same** as the previous version. It does require a bit more setup but it's worth it, as the previous python version hijacks the CPU core to ensure precise timing which can lead to 100% CPU usage on a single core.

1. Install the buzzer on your GPIO pins.
    - These buzzers usually have polarity, if not playing correctly check if you didn't swap the GND and GPIO pins!
    - If you are using a Raspberry Pi, you can use PWM and use Rpi.GPIO and skip this.
    - If using other boards without PWM, like the BTT PI v1.2 (Like I am) you can continue.
        - For BTT Pi, you can refer to this [WIKI](https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1#40-pin-gpio) to find the correct GPIO pin to use.

2. Install [gcode_shell_command](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh/blob/master/docs/gcode_shell_command.md) using Kiauh under **Extensions**.

3. Install [lgpio](https://abyz.me.uk/lg/lgpio.html) on your system.

```bash
sudo apt install swig -y
cd src
wget http://abyz.me.uk/lg/lg.zip -O /tmp/lg.zip
unzip /tmp/lg.zip -d include
cd include
make
sudo make install
```

4. Clone and build the source code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LeandroSQ/klipper-buzzer.git ~/buzzer
chmod +x ./tools/build.sh
./tools/build.sh
```

5. Add the following to your `printer.cfg` file.

```yaml
[gcode_shell_command PLAY_TUNE]
command: /home/$(whoami)/buzzer/buzzer &
timeout: 2.
verbose: True

[gcode_macro PLAY_TUNE]
gcode:
    RUN_SHELL_COMMAND CMD=PLAY_TUNE
```

6. **(EXTRA)** You can also specify a file to be played instead of randomly picking one:
```yaml
[gcode_shell_command PLAY_ONE_PIECE]
command: /home/$(whoami)/buzzer/buzzer "songs/one piece - we are.txt" &
timeout: 2.
verbose: True

[gcode_macro PLAY_ONE_PIECE]
gcode:
    RUN_SHELL_COMMAND CMD=PLAY_ONE_PIECE
```

7. **(EXTRA)** You can append your newly added GCODE Macro at the end of the machine GCODE on your slicer. So everytime a print is finished it will play your tunes.

### Adding songs

1. Find a `.mid` file of the song you want to add.
2. You can clean up the channels to keep only the melody you want using a midi editor like [Signal](https://signal.vercel.app/edit).
3. Convert the `.mid` file to notes and duration, you can use the [MIDI to M300 Converter](https://alexyu132.github.io/midi-m300/), remove `M300`, `S` and `P` from the output and add `0` on the first line.
    - First line is reserved for pitch modulation, `0` is a good start.
    - The following format per line! `NOTE_IN_HZ DURATION_IN_MS`
    - You can use `./tools/convert.sh <song>.txt` to convert the output to the correct format.
4. Save it as a `.txt` file in the `songs` folder.
5. **(Extra)** If not sounding as expected, you can change the number on the first line of your `.txt` to shift the pitch, in semitones. Usually with passive buzzers the higher the better! Try 6, 12, 18 and 24 and see what sounds best.

### Usage

You can play a song by running the following command:

```yaml
./buzzer/buzzer songs/<song>.txt
```

Or to pick a random song, just omit the filename or provide a folder:

```yaml
./buzzer/buzzer
# or
./buzzer/buzzer /tmp/another_folder_with_songs
```
